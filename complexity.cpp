Asymptotic Complexity

If we have a function f(x)=8+x^3
then the asymptotic lower bound is: Ω(x^3)

The asymptotic tight bound Θ is usually the intersection of two functions starting with big O and Omega Ω
This usually means the function is bounded above and below by the same asymptotic rate

Θ(f(n))=O(f(n))∩Ω(f(n))

Solving the problem 2T(n/2) + cn, where n>=1 and c > 0 is a constant leads to 
Θ(nlogn)
Θ(nlogn^2) this is so because transforming this to normal form by applying log rules, this will lead to Θ(2nlogn) which is equivalent to Θ(nlogn)

If we have 11 + x^3 then the upper bound big O(x^3)
